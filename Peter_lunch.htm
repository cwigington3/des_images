  <p>Everything I dreamed of and more!

      This was our first stop in Boston, but when we arrived there was a 2 hour wait time. We put our names down and went to Bricco to kill some time. We received a call within 1.5 hours from Neptune. NOTE: You have 10mins to make it back to the restaurant or they will give up your seat!
      
      Ordered:
      x Spanish Octopus - this was probably one of the best octopus I've ever had. It was so tender and juicy. All the ingredients complimented each other so well. My boyfie's sister had octopus for the first time here and really liked it! Do not be scared to try octopus here!!! It's SOOOOO GOOOD!!
      x Clam Chowder - great clam chowder. Little to no heavy cream so it was lighter than what I'm used to. Generous amounts of clam :)
      x Hot Lobster Roll - WOW, such good lobster on this roll. I think I may like the lobster at Jame Hook better, but this was SOOO good because it was bathed it butter. I didn't get to try the bread part because I was so full, but the lobster portion was very, very good. Get the hot one, not cold!
      x Variety of oysters - Tried some medium oysters and small oyster. Obviously, enjoyed the small ones better, but all were super good and fresh. No fishiness at Neptune :)
      
      This place is worth the hype IMO. Fresh seafood and a great variety to choose from. If I'm ever back, I will definitely try the ciopinno.</p>

    <h3 style="text-align:center;">Pauli's Review on Yelp</h3>
    <p>Pauli's gets 5 stars because of not only their food but their service is awesome. The dude who took my order was cool as can be and helped me with my order as I've never had a Lobster Roll before. Gave me advice on how to get it, and it was great! The roll was toasted and the lobster was definitely fresh with the Mayo & butter on the side.
        The place has such a cool vibe that made it super casual and one of the employees offered to trash my stuff afterwards which I do not expect from anyone or anywhere, this was very nice of him.
        
        Overall Pauli's is a place that has something for everyone. $24 for a Lobster roll, drink, and fries. Great deal to be honest.

      Excellent lobster roll. Not very big but what there was was packed.

      Pauli's in the North End gets packed at lunch time. With a few tables and a counter, it's very crowded. The folks behind the counter are doing a great job of managing the queue but it's clearly a busy place.
      
      Why so busy? The sandwiches are excellent. I saw an Italian go by that made me drool. But my taste buds were already promised to a lobster roll and it took about ten minutes to be prepared. It was worth being patient. Served on the usual hot dog bun, this was well loaded with big pieces of lobster meat and drawn butter. Big pieces and well stuffed. Yummy!
      
      Definitely will return to Pauli's for that Italian soon.</p>

    <p>My husband and I were excited to snag reservations for lunch on a Saturday at 12:30 after a previous attempt where we were turned away during peak hours. Reservations HIGHLY recommended.

        We knew we were in for a treat as soon as our appetizer arrived -- the Ahi Tuna Arrabbiata. It's sushi-grade ahi tuna served slightly seared on a bed of crispy potatoes and topped with olive tapenade and fresh basil. It was as delicious as it was beautiful. Our entrees were equally impressive. My husband ordered the Sunday Macaroni and I ordered the Frutti di Mare. The pasta, the sauce -- it was all perfect; and the portions, generous -- even the protein!
        
        Our waitress was lovely, as was the ambiance. We loved that they opened their floor-to-ceiling windows on this nice day so we could soak in the fresh air.
        
        We found our new favorite to bring in out of town guest to taste the best of the North End!</p>
