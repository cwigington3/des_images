  <h3 style="text-align:center;">Neptune Oyster Bar</h3>
  <p>Everything I dreamed of and more!

      This was our first stop in Boston, but when we arrived there was a 2 hour wait time. We put our names down and went to Bricco to kill some time. We received a call within 1.5 hours from Neptune. NOTE: You have 10mins to make it back to the restaurant or they will give up your seat!
      
      Ordered:
      x Spanish Octopus - this was probably one of the best octopus I've ever had. It was so tender and juicy. All the ingredients complimented each other so well. My boyfie's sister had octopus for the first time here and really liked it! Do not be scared to try octopus here!!! It's SOOOOO GOOOD!!
      x Clam Chowder - great clam chowder. Little to no heavy cream so it was lighter than what I'm used to. Generous amounts of clam :)
      x Hot Lobster Roll - WOW, such good lobster on this roll. I think I may like the lobster at Jame Hook better, but this was SOOO good because it was bathed it butter. I didn't get to try the bread part because I was so full, but the lobster portion was very, very good. Get the hot one, not cold!
      x Variety of oysters - Tried some medium oysters and small oyster. Obviously, enjoyed the small ones better, but all were super good and fresh. No fishiness at Neptune :)
      
      This place is worth the hype IMO. Fresh seafood and a great variety to choose from. If I'm ever back, I will definitely try the ciopinno.</p>

    <h3 style="text-align:center;">State Street Provisions' Review on Yelp</h3>
    <p>My go-to place when I am in town and need a bite without deal with any type of fuss. I have never had a problem getting a table during the week or on the weekends.

      Now that the weather is warmer, I really enjoy their outdoor seating area. The amount of outdoor seating is plentiful and is always great, no matter which part of the patio you sit on.
      
      I have never had a bad experience in my years of dining there. My service has always been really great, along with the food.
      
      My most recent visit included the ricotta and potato gnocchi, sriracha miso deviled eggs, and salted cod fritters. My boyfriend and I opted to just do apps instead of splitting an entr√©e and appetizer. Between the three items, there was more than enough food for both of us. The quail that was atop of the gnocchi was crispy, juicy, and flavorful. The gnocchi was tossed in a gravy-like sauce with asparagus and mushrooms. The fritters were light and crispy, served with a delicious dipping sauce. When it comes to miso in certain dishes, it tends to not be done right and can be overpowering. The deviled eggs were just right! They were season perfectly with sriracha and the miso was just the right amount, layered on the bottom of the plate. The only negative I had was that there were far too many onions in the gnocchi. Everything else was on point.
      
      We decided to go with beers instead of cocktails. Their beer selection never lets me down. I am big into IPA's, but my boyfriend...not so much. They had a few different options that suited someone who like's wheat beers or basically anything that is not an IPA.
      
      Their service is always very good, I have no complaints. We had an awesome server by the name of Jess, if I am not mistaken. She was very professional, but very personable. She ensured to come over and check on and make sure were enjoying our time there. We chatted her up a little, which was really nice. She helped make the experience that much better.
      
      If you're for a place to get a quick bite without all of the fuss, check them out. Each time I have visited, the service and food have always been good. Their beer list is always full of great options and the food is delicious. It is worth a shot!</p>

    <p>My husband and I were excited to snag reservations for lunch on a Saturday at 12:30 after a previous attempt where we were turned away during peak hours. Reservations HIGHLY recommended.

        We knew we were in for a treat as soon as our appetizer arrived -- the Ahi Tuna Arrabbiata. It's sushi-grade ahi tuna served slightly seared on a bed of crispy potatoes and topped with olive tapenade and fresh basil. It was as delicious as it was beautiful. Our entrees were equally impressive. My husband ordered the Sunday Macaroni and I ordered the Frutti di Mare. The pasta, the sauce -- it was all perfect; and the portions, generous -- even the protein!
        
        Our waitress was lovely, as was the ambiance. We loved that they opened their floor-to-ceiling windows on this nice day so we could soak in the fresh air.
        
        We found our new favorite to bring in out of town guest to taste the best of the North End!</p>

      <h3 style="text-align:center;">Oisa Ramen on Yelp</h3>
      <p>Chef Moe is cooking up delicious ramen like a boss in this small spot nestled between Bostonia and Tiki Rock. Unlike most other places, her main ramen stock is vegetable based which is unexpectedly packed with umami. For the omnivores out there she tops her ramen with delicious pork belly.
  
          This being a slurp and go, and a tiny restaurant, her ramen doesn't come out piping hot so you don't have to wait for it to cool and bcan quickly dig in. The ramen is eat in, but she does have to go plates including poke and other specials like chashu dogs. For the summer months, she recently debuted chilled ramen dishes which are very refreshing and delicious. Ask for it with extra spicy paste! It's packed during the lunch hours, but usually the wait isn't terrible and the line during dinner is pretty short. Chef Moe and her staff are also welcoming and are a wonderful addition to the neighborhood.</p>

    <h3 style="text-align:center;">State Street Sushi on Yelp</h3>
    <p>Is this State Street's best kept secret? It just might be. The place is clearly meant for take out more than dine-in - which may be why the reviews are few and far between. Nonetheless, State Street Sushi is a no frills small joint serving up good quality sushi. You can place your specific order online or you can stroll in take a peek in the cooler/fridge where there are plenty of pre-made rolls (individual or in combos).

      The thing I love about State Street is that the fish is fresh but also they aren't loading up on rice. I love ordering Futo Maki rolls and they have been a true testament to how cheap and stingy a restaurant is being if they are loaded with rice versus loaded with filling (filling varies by restaurant but here it includes sweet egg, tobiko, cukes, avo, & crab). State Street serves up fat rolls that are light on rice! My type of place.
      
      The Winter Maki with salmon, yellowtail, scallions, and cucumber inside and salmon, avo, & tobiko on top is top notch. Be warned, if you get the Yellowtail Jalapeno roll, it comes with a mild/slightly pickled jalapeno instead of the a fresh jalapeno which you may come to expect.
      
      This is definitely going to be my go-to spot for sushi in FiDi now.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
  Only open for lunchtime, State Street Sushi has a couple of stools at their counter. It's clearly designed for takeout.

When I popped in after lunch but before closing, they were still slicing fish and preparing. I grabbed a couple of boxes out of the cooler and took it to go.

Miso soup included and it was tasty with a rich broth. Two sets of rolls were both fresh and well assembled. California roll with salmon and cream cheese and crunchy cucumber was great. Another with avocado and tuna and salmon roll plus a set of salmon and tuna nigiri was a great portion.

Really good stuff!
